# FriendFinder-App

**Overview**

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results of the users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

I used Express to handle routing.  

**Steps**

1. Answer 10 questions of your choosing and submit.

2. Once you submit, the current user's most compatible friend, will be displayed as a modal pop-up.
The modal will display both the name and picture of the closest match.
